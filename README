The GNU-Emacs major mode for the programming language APDL

APDL (Ansys Parametric Design Language) is the solver scripting
language of the FEA (Finite Element Analysis) suite ANSYS (ANalysis
SYStem, registered TM http://www.ansys.com).

APDL-Mode (formerly ANSYS-Mode) represents, in conjunction with the
GNU-Emacs editor, an advanced APDL environment with features like
solver communication (GNU-Linux only), license reporting, keyword
completion, code templates, dedicated keybindings, etc.  Over the
years it has accumulated lots of features for writing and debugging
FEA models in APDL code.
