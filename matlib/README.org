  - PPS.MPA_MPL :: Celanese Fortron 1140L4 40 % glass fibre, Young's
                   modulus 80 % reduced compared to test specimen to
                   replicate a random fibre orientation.

  - creep_curves_PPS_Fortron1140l4_120degC.csv :: A 40 % short glas
       fibre filled PPS.  The stress - creep strain curves are scaled
       with a factor of 0.8 from test specimen to account for a random
       fibre orientation in thick walled parts.  They might be used as
       an example for data fitting with the TBFT command.
