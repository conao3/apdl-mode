Welcome to ANSYS-Mode, please read the accompanying tutorial
/appl/tools/ansys-mode/current/A-M_introductory_tutorial.pdf first.
(By the way: You can also view PDF files in Emacs editor and Emacs
uses the same key-bindings as the BASH shell ...)

/appl/tools/bin/A-M-16.1.1.sh starts Emacs with the APDL editing mode
enabled. For example:

 $ A-M-16.1.1.sh ../ansys-mode/current/doc/example.mac

ANSYS-Mode is automatically switched on for the following types (file
suffixes): .ans, .mac, .anf, .dat and .inp.

If you want to start Emacs in text (terminal) mode instead of its GUI
mode, please provide the command line argument `-nw', like in the
following line:

 $ A-M-16.1.1.sh macro.ans -nw

======================================================================
			     NOTE:

Most functionality works for any installed ANSYS version, but for some
advanced stuff - like calling the help documentation in your browser -
ANSYS-Mode 16.1.1 assumes that ANSYS V161 is installed on your system!
You can configure ANSYS-Mode to work together with any ANSYS version,
please have a look in the configuration file Conti.el, it is a must
since the respective menu entries doesn't work on our non default
ANSYS installation path.  (There are only two variables which might
need to be adjusted.)

======================================================================

If you want to enable ANSYS-Mode in Emacs without calling the wrapper
`A-M-16.1.1.sh', then add the following lines in your ~/.emacs file:

--->8 ----------------------------------------------------------------

(add-to-list 'load-path "/appl/tools/ansys-mode/current")
(load "A-M") ; the main ANSYS-Mode configuration file
(load "helper/tools/ansys-mode/Conti") ; the Company's configuration file
