The GNU-Emacs major mode for the programming language APDL

APDL (Ansys Parametric Design Language) is the solver scripting
language of the FEA (Finite Element Analysis) suite ANSYS (ANalysis
SYStem, registered TM https://www.ansys.com).

APDL-Mode (formerly ANSYS-Mode) represents, in conjunction with the
GNU-Emacs editor, an advanced APDL environment with features like
keyword completion, code templates, solver communication (GNU-Linux
only), license reporting, dedicated keybindings, etc.

Nowadays - with the advent of modern GUIs - I find APDL-Mode mostly
useful for studying solver (.dat) files which were created by
WorkBench.  Likewise for writing WorkBench `Command' snippets and
inspecting longer snippets from other sources.  Accessing swiftly the
ANSYS APDL reference documentation alone is worth using APDL-Mode!

------------------------------
First usage:

Please type `M-x apdl' to open a buffer under APDL-Mode.  From this
buffer you can investigate the menu entries `APDL' and `ANSYS' and
testing some APDL code.

The APDL-Mode help you'll find with typing `C-h m' together with a
brief tutorial.
