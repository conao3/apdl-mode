* Introduction
  APDL (Ansys Parametric Design Language) is the solver scripting
  language of the FEA (Finite Element Analysis) suite [[http://www.ansys.com][ANSYS]] (ANalysis
  SYStem, registered TM).

  APDL-Mode (formerly ANSYS-Mode) represents, in conjunction with the
  GNU-Emacs editor, an advanced APDL environment with features like
  solver communication (GNU-Linux only), license reporting, keyword
  completion, code templates, dedicated keybindings, etc.  Over the
  years it has accumulated lots of features for writing and debugging
  complete FEA models in APDL code. Please convince yourself with the
  APDL-Mode in-depth documentation -TODO-.

  With the advent of the modern ANSYS GUIs - like `WorkBench' or
  `AIM' - the usage of APDL as a wholesale modelling language has
  diminished.  But APDL is here to stay: `WorkBench' and `AIM' operate
  exclusively the ANSYS solver with it!  They are sending APDL input
  (.dat) files to the solver.  For a true understanding of the GUIs'
  inner workings a study of their APDL code is prerequisite.

  On the other hand the GUIs are not supporting all solver features.
  So APDL `Command Snippets' enhance the GUIs' modeling capabilities.
* Some features
  Nowadays I find APDL-Mode mostly useful in writing these `Command
  Snippets' or reading Snippets from others.  For in-depth
  investigations APDL-Mode is very convient to study the solver (.dat)
  files.
** In-built APDL command help with argument counter
   Especially for commands with a large number of arguments it is
   cumbersome to count the arguments, *C-?* facilitates this for you
   and visualises dynamically at which parameter position your cursor
   currently is.

** Code outlining for inspecting WorkBench solver (.dat) files
   APDL-Mode hides the normally uninteresting but usually very large
   number blocks.  On the right hand side is the unhidden content.

** Highlighting example
   The image shows an Emacs 23.2 frame (in reversed colour mode and
   compiled with the GTK+ toolkit under GNU-Linux) with a ripped off
   APDL-Mode menu field

* Requirements and installation
#  - APDL-Mode is now available on MELPA
#  For further installation options
   Please have a look in the [[file:INSTALLATION.org][INSTALLATION]] file.
* Usage

  Please read the introductory tutorial first. -TODO-

  Please type `M-x apdl-mode' and check out the menu bar's `ANSYS'
  entry for its possibilities and select the entry `Describe
  APDL-Mode' or type "C-h m" (i. e. the <CTRL> key together with the
  <h> key and subsequently the <m> key), which will display the
  apdl-mode help which is your `online' guide for its usage, and
  key-bindings.

* Customisation
  apdl-mode provides its own customisation file
  ~ansys-config.el~. -TODO-
* News
  Please have a look in the [[file:NEWS.org][NEWS]] file
