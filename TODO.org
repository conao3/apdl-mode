#+LATEX_HEADER:
#+title: The Todo file of ANSYS-Mode

#+STARTUP: showall
* Deficiencies:
  - Highlighting :: Experimental user variable highlighting
		    does not take into account:
    + clearing of variables and
    + usage of variables before their definitions (uninitialised
      variables)
    + the variable fontification might clash with ANSYS specifiers
    + string substitution of %variables% in strings does not highlight
       them in the proper variable face
  - Highlighting :: A label :LABEL may appear behind the /input
                    command and is not highlighted as label
  - Highlighting :: An apostrophy clashes with the ANSYS "char"
                    specifier Keybinding: M-Tab is captured under
                    Windows and some GNU-Linux desktops Workaround: Press
                    instead of M-Tab (ALT + TAB) the ESC key and then
                    the Tab key (ESC, TAB) or apply the command from
                    the menu bar
  - Highlighting :: The parameter help overlay is only removed after 2
                    min if the respective ANSYS-Mode buffer is the
                    current buffer at that time span!
  - Keybinding :: M-j: When there is already a `&' in a format command
                  (like *msg, *vwrite, *mwrite)
                  ansys-indent-format-line inserts a redundant one
  - Completion :: Of parametric function parentheses
		  completes redundant closing parentheses
  - Completion :: A mouse selection from the *ANSYS-completion* buffer
                  is only inserted upcased.
  - Completion :: ANSYS command 'C***' will not be completed
  - Skeleton :: Mouse selection of -structural-template does not work
                (because of stipulated user text input from this skeleton)
  - Navigation ::  C-c { does not skip an overlay in a number-block
                  (M-{ does it though))
* 16.1.2:
** Bugs
   - C-c C-j jjj not working with Emacs 23.1
   - Mouse completion is working with *middle* mouse button (mouse-2) but only
     on the second LMB or, in the case of C-c C-s, not at all.
   - *mwrite
     *cfclos
     M-? shows help for *mwrite, when cursor behind *cfclos and in the
     last line without \n
   - path construction in -mode.el for help program is not working, if
     ansys-mode is not activated!? <- autoloaded functions, should
     work they are calling -mode.el!
** Wish-list
   - color scheme of *msg command is only readable on terminals
   - add adwords to gh-pages
   - abreviated input method for all graphics functions zoom, etc.
   - defaults for template MP
   - Add WorkBench (Aim) concepts to APDL translation in A-M_APDL_reference

   - Correct the creep data together with young's modulus and total
     strain to creep strain!
   - add bbdb files to emacs packages?
   - variables behind / and * without whitespace in between are not
     highlighted! try changing the character syntax???
   - C-c C-a does not take signs (e.g. +13, -8) befor numbers into account
   - implement -hide-region also for rotated nodes in WB .dat files
     (frictionless support)
   - Targeting AnsysClassics (-send-to-ansys) AND ANSYS Aim
   - show defaults for -license-file, license-utility and -ansysli-servers
   - *msg command's format string is not higlighted (-template-element-table)
   - Variables are not highlighted in -skeletons, it is specified in
     -mode only for files with .mac suffix; *create file tmp,mac:
     macro call: tmp, is not highlighted
   - started and commented out highlighting of solver output
   - makefile errors when doing -fontification.el?
   - ansys-template.el:85:13:Warning: reference to free variable
     `ansys-skeleton-overlay'
   - mouse-choose-completion is obsolete since E23.2
   - example of an ansyslmd.ini?
   - add timer customisation for -command-parameter-help variable 1
     min, 2 min, etc.
   - example.mac: make it solver compatible
   - check *vwrite with gui mode and interactive mode (graphics window?)
   - add element numbers to the general completion list, yes or no?
   - WikEmacs, Melpa, GNU ELPA and/or marmalade, ANSYS-Mode debian
     .deb package
   - HTML APDL documentation
     here is the tanslation of names to html files:
     - link to ANSYS-Mode APDL reference:
     - Chapters of structural APDL documentation:
   - TODOS: in fontification.org
     - deletion of vectors *del,Vector without request? ,,nopr?
     - check character variables 32 Chars. and highlight accordingly
       string 128, char 8
     - *vscfun: mean, stdev, ...
   - -dynamic-highlighting is sluggish, highlighting somehow
     retarded!!! Still??
   - _RETURN (-mode) somewhat milder red, clashes with reseved vars!
   - test server specifications (menu!) make interconnect
     conditional of the ANSYS version >= 120
   - explain fill/*vfill under the "looping" commands: Generates a line
       of nodes between two existing nodes.
   - switch automatically to read only mode for *.dat files?
   - force harmonic table (*vfill) example in -skeleton-bc, make a
       ansys...-template out of two-mass-harmonics.mac
   - -program, -license-file and -ansysli-servers should show the
     current selections
   - check -license-file var with -license-file-check
     - Emacs var  :DONE:
     - env vars  :DONE:
     - activate -license-file function :TODO:
   - document Lagrange contact behaviour for contact/press-fit
     skeleton, critical to element differences!
   - constraint equations in -template.el and get functions
   - fontification.el
     - add the 4 ANSYS neutral file (aux15) functions to the parameter-help,
       .anf files from DM anf export
         kpt -- Write keypoints or vertices into the database
         lcurv -- Write lines or edges into the database
         asurf -- Write the area or face information into the database
         vbody -- Define a B-rep solid.
     - add Hlp_G_OPE6_NeutralFile.html (aux15 utility functions)
       commands to the fontification and help stuff: KPT, LCURV,
       ASURF, VBODY. (functions in ANF files) from the operations
       guide `ans_ope.pdf'
     - some functions in -skeleton-function are not highlighted and
       completable, whitespace problem befor paren...
       and: "nele" undocumented command and function nelem()
   - inconsistencies in A-M_introductory_tutorial.org
     - the parameter help overlay is dated
     - in variable.png symbols Ns and Ls are not highlighted as
       variables
     - change sequence of alignment.png first not aligned, second aligned
     - Too difficult: slide of extensibility, showing Emacs
       self-documenting help system for a template function
* Procedures
  - GNU-Linux :: ;-)
  - Mode Help :: keyboard input is quoted in "", emphasizing in `' and
                 keys in <>
  - APDL templates :: minimal working examples ending with -template
  - Menu :: -> indicates the following sub menu entry ->
  - M-x compile :: ALL ;-)

   GH-wiki is repo with write access for world, separate from the A-M repo!

** Freeze proceedures
  - check whether all undocumented commands
    [[elisp:(find-tag "Ansys_undocumented_commands")]]
    are still working in V 16.2
  - (tags-search "TODO")
  - (tags-search "FIXME")
  - checkdoc, -template.el, -process.el, -mode.el done except
    \\<keymap> & \\[function]
  - README -- installation (Emacs Wiki format) and accompanying files,
       features, news, history
  - update the mode help, update version numbers, default specifiers
  - update defcustom list in ./bug-report.sh -> ansys-submit-bug-report
  - update/complete skeletons menu

    # ansys
    (tags-query-replace "16.1" "16.2")
    (tags-query-replace "ANSYS 16" "ANSYS 17")
    # emacs
    (tags-query-replace "24.5" "24.6")
    # version No
    (tags-query-replace "161" "170")
    # for _mode_version
    (tags-query-replace "\".1\"" "\".2\"")
    # copyright
    (tags-query-replace "- 2015" "- 2016")
    (tags-query-replace "fontification.mac" "example.mac")

    checkdoc then dry run: Emacs
    24.5 -Q testing: example.mac /*commands and default command
    lines, every menu entry.  byte-compile-file then dry run
    profiling, major mode conventions: multiple loading of this mode?.
  - check Emacs versions on longterm OS systems compile with 24.X,
    then pretests, emacs-snapshots, clash with Emacs releases (yearly
    Emacs cycle)?

* Ideas for further versions
** Parameter help and documentation
   - Enable a mouse button to unhide hidden regions, enable an
     interactive way to unhide regions, when in the region: Return
     opens hidden region, ...
   - dynamic completion and help of parameter options, depending on
     the contex like the one in bash
   - makeinfo documentation with org-mode ox exporter
   - make completion of templates with <mouse 1> button additionally
     to <mouse 2> as in -complete-symbol.
   - create a function showing deprecated elements and their
     replacement.  Inspirations from eldoc-mode, show replacements of
     deprecated elements?
   - create a reference card
   - show list of license products and their license feature names or
     translate it in the license status from the licensing guide
     (product variable table)
   - C-c C-v show (optionally) only variables defined up to current
     cursor line.  Make the line number display in
     `ansys-display-variables' (hyper-)links to the corresponding code
     line in the respective APDL file.  (See `occur' function.)  Or
     use the imenu mechanism for this and display the variables in the
     speedbar. Count the number of user variables when displaying them
   - refcard, etc; Emacs help guidelines
     GNU programming guideline: More requires?,
   - display alternatives to/swap deprecated element types
   - M-? Help: parametric functions are not explained with the help
     command
   - M-? Help: if there are ignored characters behind the keyword, the
     keyword is not found
   - M-? the command help does not work when there are solver ignored
     characters behind the unique command name, example: *VWROOOOM.
   - M-?: following a variable allocation with `='
   - M-?: In the last empty line displays overlay below command
     instead above
   - Provide ANSYS command completion and command-help in comint
     buffer
   - Include all inquiry functions (see UPF documentation)
   - Include the _RETURN value of the solid modelling commands into
     their help strings of parameter help.
** ANSYS process and interpreter buffer
   example: gnuplot-mode
   - call to start the ANSYS solution results tracker for .nlh (xml
     see file:file.nlh, contact forces) and convergence .gst (binary?,
     coded? file:file.gst)
   - implement something like [[file:nlhist.sh]] for .cnd files (xml see
     file:file.cnd) or use the new libxml parser ;-)
   - make display-buffer "*ANSYS*" optional when sending commands to
     the ANSYS process
   - use ANSYS *env variables* like AWP_ROOT140 for checking
     installation directories
   - check also the license status for hpc licenses if
     -no-of-processors is greater then 3
   - implement ANSWAIT variable
   - autoloading of: -license-file, -license-program functions
   - dbus support of workbench or integrating emacs in workbench?
   - insert skeleton with C-c C-s i, send line C-c C-c ccc
   - warn when C-c C-c tries to send a block command (complete to full
     block?)
   - take care when region isn't complete in -send-to-ansys (send whole line)
   - C-c C-c skips empty lines and comments this is not always desirable
     -> make this optional -> filter process input?
   - C-c C-q, C-c C-u and C-c C-c sequences are not shown (and stored)
     in the comint buffer
   - make filter of -license-status optional
   - optimise -start-run with query of y (start immediately),n
     (exit),e (change params),C-h (help)
   - Splice any input line behind the BEGIN: symbol in the *ANSYS*
     buffer
   - Enable one solver run for every ANSYS macro buffer
   - indicate with activation/inactivation of menu items that an
     asynchronous job is already running or not.
   - show/mark sent lines in apdl file C-c C-u, C-c C-c,
     + with fringes
     + with background
     + maximum line
     + reset highlighting, when?
   - provide ANSYS `y' request and carriage return? superflouous?  a
     single `y' does the trick
   - Killing a buffer with a running process now asks a confirmation.
     You can remove this query in two ways: either removing
     `process-kill-buffer-query-function' from
     `kill-buffer-query-functions' or setting the appropriate process
     flag with `set-process-query-on-exit-flag'.
    - finding an ANSYS /filnam command in current macro file and
      suggesting this as current job-name optionally kill old job when
      called again with working run warn and optionally remove the
      ansys lock file before starting a run
    - search in -job for /filn arguments as default job name like in
      -display-error-file
** Skeletons, outline and abbrevs
   - show a preview buffer with the outline headlines
   - -skeleton-select is a bit thin, not yet finished?
   - add a preview mode, with its own keymap for faster editing and
     copying, like dired
   - enhance abbrev definitions for *create, *dowhile logics:
   - use the ANSYS sample input listing for template-examples
   - additional dialog boxes with:
     /ui,anno,ksel...,wpse,help,query,copy
   - make outline string in skeletons configurable
   - spider beams, _bolt.mac, screw.mac, Mohr-Coulomb criterion
   - rework concept with respect to the ANSYS menu structure sort
     skeletons in menu. Concept: 1.) ANSYS Workflow 2.) specialised
     macro library
   - Make skeleton-header properly working (info "(autotype)")
   - Optimise templates: completing-read, read-from-minibuffer
   - abbrev `d does not indent properly in another block level
   - Implement choice when completing *IF commands (*ELSEIF or *ENDIF
     ?THEN?).
   - Warn when including skeleton in read only file.
   - skeleton for numbering ansys-skeleton-numbering-controls
     (skeleton-insert docu)
   - suggestions with auto-completion of
     kp,line,area,volu,node,elem,tabn,sval
   - negation, what negation? TODO:
   - skeleton for skipping code *if,then *else*endif if selection:
     wrap around and indenting *go/*if label is not fontified at the
     command line (restriction of 7 characters with out the colon.)
     must *go:label be unambiguous?
** Miscellaneous
   - hash or signature file for packages
   - show content of matlib/ folder
   - add to -display-variables a prefix argument for showing the value
     of the variable around point, or center the variables window...
   - customisation option for a the web browser of -browse-ansys-help
   - ideas for preview also of a/the macro directory?
   - put graphics dlls in windows package
   - LSDYN support, see lsdyna.el
   - embedded calc :: include in hacking.mac
   - Alignment :: alignment "section" is not clearly defined in function
		  -align
   - alignment :: extend to vector definitions
		  t(1,0) = 20,300,3094,
		  t(1,1) =  3,  4,   9,
   - Utility for clearing files like .rst, ... or using dired, clear_files.sh?
     with listing listing of file types
   - Configure the highlighting colours with black on white background
   - C-j, M-j are not skipping to `,' whith default command (from second
     line onwards)!
   - supply command for clearing recursively not important process files:
     .rst, .log, ..., supply a customisaton variable
   - narrow, outline, transparent-font: eblocks, nblocks by default?
   - add notes for parameter help of undocumented commands (alist)
   - create filter variable for hiding not installed license types
     ("aiiges" "aihexa") or better regexp filter "ai.*\\|acf.*"
   - commands shorter than 4 chars are not allowed with additional chars
     adjust this to -highlighting-level 0
   - Make ANSYS-Mode also working solely with ansys-mode.el??
   - make M-C-h more intelligent like M-h (if mark...)
   - speed concern: replace -find-duplicate-p with function argument to
     add-to-list
   - For non-comint-mode usage: display .log file with tail mode
   - is outline-mode enabled? no! make default?, outline
   - take care of setup procedure: v110/ansys/apdl/start110.ans
     /MPLIB,READ,/ansys_inc/v110/ansys/matlib
   - removing/renaming/checking abort file?
   - Are characters behind unique commands shorter than 4 characters
     possible? No /sol(u) sufficient? Yes condensed input line ($)
     behind commands without arguments possible? Yes have a look in
     -variable-defining-commands!  Warn when - unintentionally -
     arguments are used for ANSYS commands which do not allow
     arguments.  Or implement some auto-newline feature?  But
     problematic in condensed command lines or when applying code
     comments!
   - undocumented ask parameter
   - mode-line-format nil);no mode line for this buffer Unambiguous
   - Emacs: old-style backquotes?  used in the old template macro system
   - completion of function names: cursor should end within parentheses
   - better hints for auto-insertion features
   - up/down-block when we are over a begin-keyword and in a block-end
     line
   - component names are fontified as variables! separate them cmlist?
   - format string for *VWRITE: line(s) below, in parens, when FORTRAN
     format specifiers are used, keyword SEQU povides row numbers, up
     to 19 parameters are allowed
   - remove vestiges of ansys-mod.el for making ansys-mode.el GPL
     proof.  Check whether octave-mod.el really is GPL compliant, use
     -ctave-mod.el from 1997, kill octave-mod.el afterwards in
     makefile read every symbol docu string ->NEW_C or _C or OCTAVE_C
   - replace/extend column-ruler with ruler-mode or ruler implemented as
     overlay in buffer
   - make everything completely customisable, eg auto-insert stuff
     customisable enable, Emacs customisation of auto-insert-query
   - Fontify *completion list* distinguishing elements: commands,
     functions and keywords.
   - provide a list of options for the -license function, set this
     function in the defcustom lmstat -a etc.
   - auto-indent-switch as defcustom?
   - inhibit the unnecessary blink-matching-block display when closing a
     block behind a block-end keyword
   - highlight matching block keywords (similar to show-paren-mode) when
     point is at keyword
   - Implement highlighting of bracket pairs with the correct level in
     ANSYS GET- and parametric- functions.
   - highlighting of plot commands inside the /GCMD command
   - DEFSUBSTs with DEFUNs inside aren't particularly helpful?
   - Emphasise better implied (colon) loops n,(1:6),(2:12:2) => n,1,2
     $ n,2,4 $... (little used, I know, but any ideas going beyond the
     colon?).
   - startup screen for ANSYS mode: Mode help, ANSYS version,
     supressing the startup screen 'ansys-mode-startup-message maybe
     as advice when sluggish -> compiliation
   - Enable choice for /show,3d or x11 (-start-graphics)
   - Provide a way to send commands to the tcl-tk ANSYS gui (x11
     programming).
** ANSYS syntax restrictions not (yet) accounted for
   - Parentheses can only be nested 4 levels deep and only up to 9
     operations (+,-,*,...) within these set of parentheses
   - PATH name is restricted to 8 chars
   - *SET parameter strings may only be 32 character long!
   - Character parameters are restricted to only 8 characters.
   - *MSG command can only have 9 additional continuation lines
   - Code line restriction of 640 characters
   - Block level restriction of 20 levels of nested *DO loops (except
     with /INPUT and *USE)
   - Block level restriction of 10 levels of nested *IF blocks
   - Macro level restriction: 20 macros
** Unknown ANSYS stuff
   - what the heck is the *UILIST command?
   - Is hyper56 a valid element?
** Additional APDL macro resources
