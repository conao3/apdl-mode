<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Introduction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
This project supports your workflows with the FEA (Finite Element
Analysis) suite <a href="http://www.ansys.com/">ANSYS</a> (ANalysis SYStem, registered TM).
</p>

<p>
It provides `ANSYS-Mode', an add-on to the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs">GNU Emacs editor</a> for
investigating and coding APDL (Ansys Parametric Design Language).  The
mode offers also managing and communication capabilities for various
ANSYS processes, like interactive code debugging with the solver or
inquiring the license manager status, etc.  Some features are quite
sophisticated but its documentation is targeted for ANSYS users with
little Emacs experience.
</p>

<p>
Advantages compared to other APDL editors: Largest feature set, user
extensible, cost-free, GNU Emacs integrated tools, available for all
OS, for the mode's in-built APDL help no ANSYS installation necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/home.en.html">GNU</a> (Gnu's Not Unix) Emacs is an up-to-date, powerful and extensible -
yet free - editor. High quality software available for every operating
system where ANSYS is running.
</p>

<p>
Ansys-Mode since version 15.0.1 is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. The latest
sources you'll find on its <a href="https://github.com/dieter-wilhelm/ansys-mode">ANSYS-Mode project site</a>.
</p>

<p>
The current stable version 16.1.1 of ANSYS-Mode is available at the
<a href="https://github.com/dieter-wilhelm/ansys-mode/releases">Github releases site</a> or at <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bxnk08BGWfexUThqbWxLX1NyeTg">Google's ANSYS-Mode drive</a>.  There are
residing 3 archive packages: 1) A package of ANSYS-Mode together with
binaries of Emacs for Windows, 2) a source file package for compiling
the latest stable Emacs version together with ANSYS-Mode and 3) the
sources of ANSYS-Mode alone, intended for an existing Emacs
installation.  You might fetch these archives via the command line
way, e. g. for the version of ANSYS-Mode bundled with Emacs binaries
for Windows:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">wget https://github.com/dieter-wilhelm/ansys-mode/releases/download/release-16.1.1/ansys-mode-16.1.1.emacs-24.5-bin-i686-mingw32.zip
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Important parts of the code (completions, help strings, etc.) are
based on the ANSYS documentation.  Besides source files and the Emacs
editor you will find tutorials in the download section.  For an
immediate impression have a look at the
[<a href="http://duenenhof-wilhelm.de/dieter/ansys-mode_tutorial/A-M_introductory_tutorial.html">http://duenenhof-wilhelm.de/dieter/ansys-mode_tutorial/A-M_introductory_tutorial.html</a>
introductory on-line version], here you are able to see the images in
a higher resolution as in the PDF version.  And in the
[<a href="http://duenenhof-wilhelm.de/dieter/ansys-mode_tutorial/A-M_in-depth_tutorial.html">http://duenenhof-wilhelm.de/dieter/ansys-mode_tutorial/A-M_in-depth_tutorial.html</a>
in-depth on-line tutorial] there is the source code highlighting
better preserved as in its PDF version.
</p>

<p>

<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Requirements</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
The mode was tested with Emacs-24.5 under Win7 and GNU/Linux64.  It
should also run with older versions of Emacs down to Emacs-23.
</p>

<p>
Some of ANSYS-Mode's solver control and communication features are
only implemented for GNU/Linux systems.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Features</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Command syntax help inbuilt in the mode (similar to but more verbose
then the ANSYS dynamic prompt), undocumented commands are hinted as
such. (There is no need to have ANSYS installed for it to work.)
</li>

<li>Opening the detailed ANSYS help in your web browser for an APDL
command or element name (the element number is sufficient) at or
before the cursor.  Optionally you can input the desired string
interactively with a completion of all valid keywords.
</li>

<li>ANSYS process management (viewing error files, license status,
starting the ANSYS help browser, etc.).
</li>

<li>Solver communication facilities, i. e. sending code fragments from
the macro file or commands interactively to an ANSYS solver process
(GNU/Linux only).  With abreviated input method: For the often used
command C-c C-j (<code>ansys-send-to-ansys-and-proceed</code>, sending a code
line to the solver and skipping to the next) it is sufficient to
repeat this command just with the last input key(s) ("j" or "C-j").
</li>

<li>Keyword completion of ANSYS commands, elements, get- and
parametric-functions (case-sensitive) of around 2000 ANSYS symbols.
</li>

<li>Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for code navigation: Skipping
comments, navigating number blocks, searching and creating *DO-,
*IF-, *DOWHILE-, *CREATE-blocks, etc.
</li>

<li>Warning of deprecated element types with a different highlighting of
element names in current and deprecated technology.
</li>

<li>Syntax highlighting in various decoration levels (complete ANSYS
keywords, undocumented commands, deprecated elements, &#x2026;)  and
optionally also user defined variables (experimental feature).
</li>

<li>Overview of <b>every</b> variable definition (*GET, *DIM, *SET, =, *DO,
CM, *VGET, &#x2026;), as well as component names, in the current file.
These are shown in another window.  In the highest decoration level
(2) these `user variables' are dynamically highlighted as well.
With a running ANSYS interpreter process (GNU/Linux only) it is also
possible with a keyboard shortcut to query the current status of
variables near the cursor.
</li>

<li>Preview and/or insertion of extensible APDL code templates.  For
example the function template shows <b>all</b> available ANSYS
parametric- and get functions. The respective code snippets show
examples of APDL work flows and considerable ANSYS know-how, these
are easily extensible to boot.  The templates are partly interactive
i. e. they are asking for or completing user input.
</li>

<li>Alignment (beautification) of whole paragraphs or marked sections
with variable definitions.
</li>

<li>Narrowing, i. e. hiding, of uninteresting content. This is done by
default for number blocks (nblock, eblocks and cmblocks) in
WorkBench created solver input file (with the suffix .dat).  You
can, in case the need arises, unhide and inspect these as well.
</li>

<li>Outlining (hiding and navigating) of code sections with Emacs'
outline-minor-mode. With outline strings '!@' you have a heading
structure which you can collapse or show.  This is the textual
analog to the WorkBench tree view.
</li>

<li>Auto-insertion (optionally) of a header and outline code for every
new APDL file.
</li>

<li>Convenient comment handling, commenting out whole paragraphs or
whole control blocks and vice versa.
</li>

<li>Auto-indentation of looping blocks and conditional control blocks
together with closing of open blocks with auto-insertion of the
appropriate end keyword (case-sensitive).
</li>

<li>ANSYS-Mode defines abbreviations for APDL templates i. e. with
writing a `nickname' after a special key triggers an exchange of the
characters with a complete code template.
</li>

<li>You are able to use all Emacs' facilities, like the built-in
calculator, file manager, image viewer and many others.  ANSYS-Mode
changes some Emacs default behaviour to alleviate the transition
from other editors and user interface standards.
</li>
</ul>

with the GTK+ toolkit under GNU/Linux) with a ripped off menu field.  The
APDL file is in the right window with the (experimental) user variable
highlighting switched on and a help overlay (in yellow background)
activated. The smaller windows on the left hand side are showing the
`Variable definitions buffer' of the same file and a preview buffer of
a certain code template, respectively.

<p>
The version scheme is a mixture of the ANSYS release (currently
"16.1") on which the highlighting and completing code is based and the
version increments (currently ".1") of ANSYS-Mode (thus "16.1.1") for
this particular ANSYS release.

<b>For Windows systems</b>:
</p>

<p>
If applicable please grab the package of a pre-compiled Emacs-24.5
(Win32/64) bundled with a preconfigured ANSYS-Mode at above Github
site and unpack this archive anywhere on your system (you do not need
administrator rights).  You might subsequently run the program
addpm.exe (located in the bin directory) to add an Emacs entry to the
Windows start menu (please refer to the README.W32 file) otherwise
start the Emacs executable runemacs.exe from there.
</p>

<p>
ANSYS-Mode is now immediately available, by opening (check out the
`example.mac' example) or by creating a new APDL file with a
.mac suffix.  Have fun!
</p>

<p>
Most functionalities should work out of the box, but if you have NOT
installed ANSYS in its default installation directory on drive
`C:Program Files' on Win64 and you want to start&#x2013;for
example&#x2013;'anslic_admin' or the ANSYS help browser directly from Emacs
please adjust the configuration file `default.el' file in Emacs'
`site-lisp' directory according to the commented code examples.  If
you are using your own configuration file, please remember that it is
loaded <b>before</b> `default.el'; this means that ANSYS-Mode settings done
by Emacs' customisation system or written in your configuration file
might be overwritten by `default.el'.  If you remove `default.el' or
set 'inhibit-default-ini' to non-nil in your own init file, then
default.el is not loaded any longer.
</p>

<p>
In case you want to download or have already installed the <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/">original version</a>
of GNU Emacs, you can also download and configure the
ANSYS-Mode package separately. Please refer to below instructions.
</p>

<p>
<b>For existing Emacs installations on Windows and GNU/Linux</b>:

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-6-2-1">
<p>
Important prerequisite: Emacs must know where all the code (.el or its
compiled versions .elc) files reside!  Extract the mode archive into
an Emacs directory which is in its default load-path (a good place is
the `site-lisp' folder in your Emacs installation tree) or indicate
the directory with the environment variable EMACSLOADPATH).
</p>

<p>
From there on you must load first the mode definitions with `M-x
load-file ansys-mode RET', i. e. typing "M-x" (first) the &lt;Alt&gt; key
and then the &lt;x&gt; key simultaneously, you'll end up in the so called
Emacs minibuffer prompt, now type "load-file" (you might apply the
&lt;TAB&gt; key for the Emacs auto-completion feature at every intermediate
stage) and conclude this input with the &lt;RET&gt; key. Emacs will then
prompt you for a file, type in the directory where you have extracted
the code and "ansys-mode.el" (or "ansys-mode.elc" - for loading speed
reasons - if the compiled version is available) and press RET to
execute the loading.  Thereafter call the mode itself with `M-x
ansys-mode RET' for every new or existing APDL file.

<p>
Extract the files somewhere on disc and put the following paragraph
into your `~/.emacs' or `~/.emacs.d/inti.el' configuration file in
your home directory `~', which is determined by the environment
variable HOME (on both Windows and Unix), adjust the stuff below in

<li>Direct way, no configuration necessary (loading `by hand')
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please consult the `direct way' description above.
</p>

<p>
If you are unfamiliar by these concepts I suggest working through the
build-in tutorial of GNU Emacs (you'll find it in the help entry in
the menu bar), it doesn't take too much time and the investment will
be worth it since it will accelerate your general editing capabilities
in the future.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Permanent configuration
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please have a look at the accompanying `default.el' customisation
example. It can be used as a configuration file (after moving it
e. g. to <code>/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp</code> or
<code>c:\\EMACS_INSTALLDIR\\site-lisp</code>, hint: The directory <code>site-lisp/</code> in
the Emacs installation tree is in its default load-path).  Yet
`default.el' is loaded AFTER your personal Emacs configuration file
(if there is any) `~/.emacs' (or `~/.emacs.d/init.el')!  If you intend
to change the following settings with Emacs' customisation system or
changing them directly in your personal configuration file, you must
either set the variable `inhibit-default-ini' to `t' <code>(setq
inhibit-default-ini t)</code> in your personal configuration file or remove
`default.el' otherwise your settings might be overwritten!
</p>

<p>
If the ANSYS-Mode files (*.el) are NOT placed in a default Emacs
load-path it is necessary to adjust the following variable.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(add-to-list 'load-path
             <span style="color: #8b2252;">"C:\\YOUR\\DIRECTORY\\WHERE\\MODE\\FILES\\RECIDE"</span>)

<p>
For example: "c:\\emacs\\ansys-mode" on a Windows system or
 "/usr/local/src/emacs/ansys-mode" on a GNU/Linux system.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<p>
From here you are able to type "M-x ansys-mode RET" to activate the
mode for every interesting file.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Automatic mode assignment
</li>
</ul>

<p>
When you intend to apply the mode automatically, for all files with
the extensions `.mac', `.dat', `.inp' and `.anf' ( .dat and .inp are
WorkBench's solver input file suffixes) you are opening, add the
following to your `.emacs' file:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(<span style="color: #8b2252;">"\\.mac$"</span> . ansys-mode))

<span style="color: #b22222;">;; </span><span style="color: #b22222;">this is the suffix for "ANSYS Neutral Files" which include some APDL.</span>
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(<span style="color: #8b2252;">"\\.anf$"</span> . ansys-mode))
</pre>

which contains also an APDL header and footer.

</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

The `user variable' highlighting is still experimental, newly edited
variable definitions are taken into account only when the variable
ansys-dynamic-highlighting-flag is set (for very large files this
slows Emacs and this flag is only implemented for `.mac' files) or any
times when you activate the variable display (with C-c C-v) and the
maximum highlighting level.  If not already the case try to use the
code in compiled form, please have a look at the documentation of the
Emacs function `byte-recompile-directory'.
</p>

<p>
ANSYS `format line' (multi-line highlighting) and `user variable'
highlighting (when the mentioned flag above is not set) are somewhat
brittle, please use "M-o M-o" to update the fontification in case the
format line and all variables are not highlighted correctly.

The unwieldy and usually uninteresting pure number blocks (the

Added a function (C-c C-b or "M-x ansys-browse-ansys-help") showing
the detailed ANSYS help in your web-browser for an APDL command or
element name (also the element number is sufficient) around the
cursor (or if that fails at the line beginning).
</p>

<p>
Are you also tired of the ANSYS help browser?  For example try
searching for the `F' APDL command, it is impossible! (update 2014:
This has improved with the new help viewer in V15.) You have to pick
it up from the alphabetical command list. Likewise when you are
searching for an incomplete keyword, no hint, no completion,
nothing!  Finding and browsing relevant APDL documentation is still
cumbersome and too slow.
</p>

<p>
As a highlight of this release you can now read immeadiately the
detailed ANSYS help in your web browser for <b>all</b> APDL command AND
element names around the cursor (or for the first command in the
current line if that fails to be valid keyword).  You may input your
search string also interactively, including its completion to ANSYS
help keywords and of certain help categories, like `Release Notes'
and such. This is an ideal complement to ANSYS-Mode's in-built
`command syntax help'.
</p>
</li>

<li>The function `ansys-start-ansys' is now available under Windows as well
and starts the APDL product launcher under this platform.
</li>

<li>When calling `ansys-browse-ansys-help' and
`ansys-show-command-parameters' (M-? - the in-built `command syntax
help') with a prefix argument for interactively entering a command
name, the name is now completable.  And in the non-interactive mode
both functions working also for APDL commands which are commented
out as well (only for the first command in case of
`ansys-show-command-parameters').

<li>Also the input of `ansys-query-ansys-command' (C-c C-q) is now
completable to all current ANSYS commands and with an optional
prefix argument the current code line is copied as the initial
input.
</li>

<li>Improved the introductory and the in-depth tutorial and extended the
documentation with an APDL and syntax highlighting reference in HTML
and PDF. (To some degree syntax highlighted in the PDF version as
well)
</li>

<li>Values of the `_RETURN' variable are now documented in the function
`ansys-skeleton-information'
</li>

<li>`ansys-next-code-line' and `ansys-previous-code-line' (M-n, M-p) are
now skipping over node and elements blocks, which are only pure
number blocks.  They are now alternatives to
`ansys-number-block-start' C-c { and C-c } respectively
</li>

<li>Removed bug in customisation system and dropped 32 bit ANSYS support
in line with the ANSYS OS
[<a href="http://www.ansys.com/Support/Platform+Support">http://www.ansys.com/Support/Platform+Support</a> strategy] for 2013.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Enhanced the documentation, included is now an introductory tutorial
`ansys-mode_tutorial.pdf' and a hands-on tutorial
`APDL_tutorial.pdf'
</li>

<li>Added a timer for getting rid of the parameter help overlays after
some time interval (1 min) without reusing the parameter help
</li>

<li>Added a (customisable) variable `ansys-no-of-processors' and
function with the same name for specifying the number of processors
for an Ansys multiprocessor run
</li>

<li>Activated outline-minor-mode and auto-insertion (in default_el)
</li>

<li>Extended mode commands, templates and removed typos mainly in
ansys-template.el. For example added all *get functions in the
ansys-skeleton-function template
</li>

<li>Added a custom variable the corresponding function
ansys-ansysli-servers for specifying the ansys interconnect license
servers
</li>

<li>Added a new shortcut and menu entry isometric view
</li>

<li>Applied sensible defaults to ansys-lmutil-program, ansys-program and
ansys-help-program, for most needs it should now be enough just to
set the used ansys version (ansys-current-ansys-version, if it is
not 140, see the example config file default_el) and maybe
additionally the installation directory (ansys-install-directory).

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Added support for aligning whole sections of Ansys variable

<li>Refined some abbreviation definitions and focused the display of
abbreviations to the mode specific ones
</li>

<li>Fixed insert pair functions, like 'C-c %'

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some new graphics commands like ansys-zoom-in, -zoom-out,
-move-left, -right, -up, -down, etc.
</li>

<li>The lisp code had to be split up for better maintance, the code
files for are now provided in an archive together with their
compiled state for speed reasons.
</li>

<li>Reworked the fontification mainly for the sake of speed.  There are
now highlighting levels to choose from, offering e. g. higlighting
of deprecated element types in a warning-face, deprecated Ansys *
comments and so on
</li>

<li>Updated and improved the readability of the mode's help and the
README file
</li>

<li>The output from the LMUtil license status tool (C-c C-l) is now
filtered on UNIX to be more concise.
</li>

<li>The `ansys-send-to-ansys' (C-c C-c) and the ansys-copy-or-send-above
(C-c C-u) commands are now generalised so that they are also doing
some useful stuff without a running Ansys interpreter process (they
copy in that case the cursor line/the chosen region and copy from
the file beginning to the cursor line, respectively, to the
clipboard).  Given a prefix argument to these commands, the cursor
won't move to the next code line.
</li>

<li>The completion of Ansy keywords is reworked and has improved.  Ansys
symbols are now completed in 3 ways: Upcase, downcase and
capitalise.
</li>

<li>New: Added tooltips to all Ansys menu entries.  Activated or
deactivated menue entries according to the context
</li>

<li>Ansys mode tries to gather information from the OS environment when
the variable `ansys-license-file' is not set by the user and uses
now Ansys standard names as default values for some more variables.
</li>

<li>The variables in the variable summary are now sorted according to
their first occurance and not any longer in "definition types".  Now
component names are included with the variable highlighting.
</li>

<li>Added menu entry for reloading Ansys Mode for the case when certain
customisation options in the code files itself are changed and
require a code reloading to take effect.

transition from other editors

<li>New: Offers Ansys process management: Acquiring license server
information in a buffer Starting and stopping asynchronously
Ansys runs.  Sending code lines to running Ansys process (sort of
code debugging facility) and getting the output into a buffer.
</li>

<li>New: Experimental highlighting of user defined variables.
Redefinition and clearing of variables is not yet taken into
account.
</li>

<li>New: Emacs customisation facility is available for the new Ansys
mode group.
</li>

<li>New: Emacs outline-minor-mode is readily available in conjunction
with this mode.
</li>

<li>Completions of Ansys commands are now case-sensitive, with
additional completion of function and element names.
</li>

<li>Previously defined skeletons are fully functional now, new ones
are added and enabled with the abbreviation and auto-load
facilities of Emacs 22.
</li>

<li>Ansys' interpreter's disregard of any capitalisation is now fully
taken into account in the highlighting.
</li>

<li>The apostrophe "'" is now assigned as the Ansys string and the
value of character parameters delimiter and not wrongly """;
the strings are fontified accordingly.
</li>

<li>The dollar sign "$" is now emphasised as the Ansys condensed
input character (multiple Ansys commands in one line).
</li>

<li>The colon ":" is now emphasised as the Ansys colon do loop
character ("(x:y:z)" means from x to y, in z steps, z is equal to
one as default).  For example: "n,(1:6),(2:18:2)" runs 6 loops.
Colon loops are working also with real values: k,,(2.5:3:0.1) and
with array parameters: k,,A(1:100), but the latter is an
undocumented feature. Since ansys 11.0 the colon looping is also
working with *GET functions (example: A(1:5)=NX(1:5))). A ":"
indicates also a beginning of a label for the *GO and *IF
command.
</li>

<li>"%" is now distinguished as the Ansys parameter substitution
and format specifier character.
</li>

<li>The ampersand "&amp;" is now correctly highlighted as the only
available Ansys continuation character applicable to the format
commands (*MSG, *MWRITE, *VREAD and *VWRITE) command and the
subsequent format strings of the command are fontified.
</li>

<li>New: " *" (SPC before *) is indicated as an (Ansys deprecated)
comment sign e. g.: %% a = 3 **4 %% results in "a" having the value
3, whereas %% a = 3**4 %% sets "a" to 81!
</li>

<li>New: A line beginning with a comma is indented to the length of the
last non slash or asterisk command as a reminder that the Ansys
solver interprets this as a space holder for the last command
keyword (the Ansys default command concept).
</li>

<li>Extended documentation, code cleaning and simplification of commands
(e.g. comment handling) with the application of standard Emacs 22
facilities among other things.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
</p>

<p>
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</p>

<p>
Preamble
</p>

<p>
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.
</p>

<p>
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program&#x2013;to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
</p>

<p>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
</p>

<p>
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
</p>

<p>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.
</p>

<p>
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
</p>

<p>
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.
</p>

<p>
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
</p>

<p>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
</p>

<p>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Definitions.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
</p>

<p>
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.
</p>

<p>
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
</p>

<p>
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
</p>

<p>
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.
</p>

<p>
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.
</p>

<p>
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
</p>

<p>
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Source Code.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.
</p>

<p>
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.
</p>

<p>
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
</p>

<p>
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.
</p>

<p>
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.
</p>

<p>
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Basic Permissions.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
</p>

<p>
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
</p>

<p>
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.
</p>

<p>
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Conveying Verbatim Copies.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
</p>

<p>
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Conveying Modified Source Versions.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
</p>

<p>
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
it, and giving a relevant date.
</p>

<p>
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
released under this License and any conditions added under section
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
</li>
</ol>
<p>
"keep intact all notices".
</p>

<p>
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
</p>

<p>
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
work need not make them do so.
</p>

<p>
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Conveying Non-Source Forms.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:
</p>

<p>
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
customarily used for software interchange.
</p>

<p>
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
</p>

<p>
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
with subsection 6b.
</p>

<p>
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
</p>

<p>
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
charge under subsection 6d.
</p>

<p>
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.
</p>

<p>
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.
</p>

<p>
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.
</p>

<p>
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).
</p>

<p>
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.
</p>

<p>
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Additional Terms.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.
</p>

<p>
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
</p>

<p>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
</p>

<p>
a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
</p>

<p>
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
Notices displayed by works containing it; or
</p>

<p>
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
</p>

<p>
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
authors of the material; or
</p>

<p>
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
</p>

<p>
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
those licensors and authors.
</p>

<p>
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.
</p>

<p>
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.
</p>

<p>
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Termination.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).
</p>

<p>
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.
</p>

<p>
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
</p>

<p>
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
</p>

<p>
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
</p>

<p>
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Patents.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
</p>

<p>
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.
</p>

<p>
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.
</p>

<p>
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.
</p>

<p>
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.
</p>

<p>
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.
</p>

<p>
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
</p>

<p>
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Revised Versions of this License.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
</p>

<p>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.
</p>

<p>
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.
</p>

<p>
  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Disclaimer of Warranty.

</ol>

<p>
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT

OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF

<p>
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING

THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD

<p>
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,

an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a

<p>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
</p>

<p>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
</p>

<p>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
</p>

<p>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
</p>

<p>
&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
</p>

<p>
This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.
</p>

<p>
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.
</p>

<p>
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program.  If not, see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.
</p>

<p>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
</p>

<p>
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
</p>

<p>
&lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
</p>

<p>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
</p>

<p>
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
